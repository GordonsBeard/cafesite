Cafe of Broken Dreams: The Website
========

The working code for the Cafe of Broken Dreams, a django monstrosity.

This probably won't be used by anyone but myself. If I have done something Very Wrong(tm), please be kind enough to let me know. Putting my code up here is p. terrifying because it's bad - but I'm hoping to scare myself into writing slightly less bad code.

What is included?
-----------------
### cafe
This will contain the core brain of the site, mostly dealing with user profiles at the moment.

### news
A typical news/post app.

### srcquery
A small mini app that I'm messing with that will query/manage our srcds servers.

What is it using?
-----------------
This will get updated when I remember more of what I've stolen.
